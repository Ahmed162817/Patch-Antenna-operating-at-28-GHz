A dual-polarized patch antenna operating at 28 GHz is a type of antenna designed to transmit and receive signals in two orthogonal polarizations, typically vertical and horizontal.
This capability is particularly beneficial in modern communication systems, including 5G networks
where it can help to improve signal quality and increase data throughput by mitigating polarization mismatches and enhancing diversity reception.
